Box services have sprung up in the last few years to offer a certain category of tailored goods (games, makeup, food/drinks, clothes, etc.)
 to busy people who don't have the time to search out the individual items themselves (see boxes.mysubscriptionaddiction.com for examples).
  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a website for such a subscription box company, including the following features:
   As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to enter my info and sign up so I can start receiving regular monthly boxes.
   As a registered user, I want to take a survey about my likes/dislikes so I can be put in a targeted demographic to get the exact box 
   contents that I want.
   As a registered user, I want an easy way to see how much I owe this month so I can budget accordingly.
   As an administrator user, I want to see an account breakdown: the total amount of accounts, what percentage belong to which demographic,
   and how much money is being paid monthly overall.
   Bonus: Add PayPal integration to actually implement payment features.
