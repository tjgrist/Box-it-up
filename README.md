# Box-it-up

This is an ASP.NET MVC application called "Sourcd" that uses the Entity Framework. 

After filling out a short survey, a user may sign up and choose a box to recieve monthly.

The user is then taken to their homepage, which displays their information, and offers links to change the box they recieve as well as see suggested boxes based on their survey answers. 

An administrator of the application then can access a protected profile page that displays the information of all the users, the total number of customers, and the total amount of sales.
